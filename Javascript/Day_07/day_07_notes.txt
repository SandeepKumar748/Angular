Arrays:

// Traditional for loop
    - It is flexible to loop at any position 

// for-in loop
    - We can't start from a specific index or we can't traverse from end 

// for-of loop
    - 

// forEach -> we can't break in between


// Delete deletes the value but the length doesn't end, <item is empty> is shown at deleted index
delete student[2]

// instance functions
// static functions -> accessed through Array class as reference
    Array.isArray(arr)
